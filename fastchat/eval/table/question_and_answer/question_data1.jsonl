What other methods are there? \nA: Another option is crowdfunded equity, which is similar to traditional fundraising but allows token holders to hold a stake in the DAO. This option can be a great way to incentivize people to participate in the organization and benefit from its success.", "category": "conversition summarize"}

If people are unable to pay for their medical care, then it should be covered by health insurance. Otherwise, people will avoid seeking the care they need.\nA: But if health insurance covers all medical costs, then it could become too expensive and cause insurance companies to go out of business. \nB: That's true, but if health insurance doesn't cover all medical costs, then there are certain people who will not be able to get the care they need. \nC: That's why I think there needs to be a balance between what is covered and what isn't.
