Additionally, the Ethereum network has a clear roadmap and vision, which has helped to attract a large user base and increase adoption.\nB: That's interesting.

A progressive taxation system is one where the tax rate increases as the income of the taxpayer increases.

This helps to ensure that the burden of taxation is distributed fairly across society.\nB: But won't this discourage people from working hard and earning more?\nDrucker: Not necessarily.
