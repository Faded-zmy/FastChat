It is important to have a system in place that covers essential medical care while also considering the financial sustainability of insurance companies. The determination of what is deemed medically necessary should be made by medical professionals and experts in the field. One way to ensure that insurance companies prioritize necessary medical care is to have regulations in place that hold them accountable. These regulations could include requirements for coverage of essential medical care and penalties for denying necessary care. Additionally, consumers can also play a role in holding insurance companies accountable by choosing plans that prioritize necessary medical care over profits. The cost of healthcare is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. One way to address the cost of healthcare is to focus on preventative care, which can help reduce the need for expensive medical treatments. Additionally, there needs to be more transparency in healthcare pricing, so that consumers can make informed decisions about their care. Finally, there needs to be a focus on reducing administrative costs in the healthcare system, which can help reduce overall costs.
